\begin{abstract}
  In  this short  paper,  we report  on our  experience  setting up  a
  monthly  reading group  around  the  socio-technical challenges  and
  ethics of computer science and  digitalization. Our reading group is
  the result  of an  encounter between  four computer  scientists with
  different backgrounds and career paths,  who work in different areas
  of computer systems, and who  live in different places. Beyond these
  factual differences,  we share an  eagerness to talk with  our peers
  not only  about our technical contributions  to digital developments
  but also about their implications on the future of our societies.
\end{abstract}

\section{The need to discuss}

The  incidence of  digital developments  in day-to-day  life has  been
massive over  the last  30 years.  From the  way a  large part  of our
interactions  takes  place  today  to the  way  vital  infrastructures
operate or the way the  world’s geopolitics is shaped, the realization
of digital tools and technologies is far from being a technical matter
only. As practitioners of computer science, both through our education
in college and through our  professional occupation, we, as co-authors
of this paper, acknowledge that  we have directly been contributing to
the construction of this digital era.

Before being computer scientists, we are people who live, work, evolve
in a  set era and  a set system,  and indifferently from  non computer
scientists,   are  recipient   of  the   outcomes  of   these  digital
developments. This  status of  both the  operator of  developments and
their recipient makes us greatly think about what happens with the use
and  the application  of digital  constructs and  technologies in  the
wild. It  is however not  always straightforward to  communicate these
interrogations in our professional communities that often dismiss such
considerations as irrelevant to the purpose of the community.

Although, we do realize that talking with our peers about these issues
is fundamental to broaden a  perspective that can otherwise easily get
defined  by  the  view  of   an  epsilon  percentage  of  the  world’s
population. We  therefore decided  to set  a reading  group up  in the
manner of  a café-philo  for computer  science that  lets participants
share and  express their  opinion on anything  related to  the digital
world.

\section{Reading to debate}

For the  four of  us, the reading  group is a  side project.  It takes
place  in  sessions organized  on  a  monthly  basis. The  setting  is
informal. The objective is to encourage  the free sharing of ideas and
opinions. The time for discussion  is constrained only by the one-hour
slot limit reserved for this activity.

Each  session  is led  by  one  of  the  participants, on  a  rotating
basis. The  lead for the  session presents a  piece of material  to be
discussed. The choice  of the material is entirely up  to the lead. It
can be  a scientific publication,  a book  targeted to a  more general
audience,  an audio  or  a video,  a documentary,  an  article from  a
newspaper, etc., anything that can  trigger a discussion regarding the
role and impact  of digitalization. Sessions are  usually not formally
concluded. The debate remains open  and the topics discussed are aimed
to support each of us with new ideas and perspectives to be applied in
our practice, as well as to consolidate a general reflection.

Our reading  group has been  meeting for  two years during  which many
different topics  were debated. One  of the sessions was  for instance
dedicated to  discussing the workshop  on the environmental  impact of
Internet   applications  and   systems  organized   by  the   Internet
Architecture Board in 2022 \cite{IAB22}.  Other sessions focused on AI
with the recent paper by Michael  Cook on the social responsibility in
the  domain  of Game  AI  \cite{Cook21},  the  book “Weapons  of  Math
Destruction” by  Cathy O’Neil  \cite{WMD16} or  a selection  of papers
presented at the ACM FAccT 2023 conference.

In between sessions, we also  exchange links to interesting content on
a Slack channel.

\section{Implementation challenges}

Over the course of the last two years, we had to make some adjustments
to the way we carry out the  activity, an experience from which we are
also learning.

We reside  in different geographical  areas located in  different time
zones. The sessions take place online which corresponds to morning and
late afternoon calls depending on our  location. The choice of a video
conferencing tool adapted  to our requirements and needs  has not been
straightforward.   We want  something  easily  accessible, secure  and
respectful of private communication.

When we  started the  group, we did  not set any  agenda prior  to the
session.  The discussion  was  entirely unstructured.  We did  however
realize that such a format was  not sustainable in the long run. There
was naturally a need for some directions. We therefore decided to turn
the discussion room into a reading  group by which one person would be
responsible to  present a  piece of  work to the  others from  which a
discussion could be engaged.

It  is essential  for us  to keep  the reading  group informal.  While
highly rewarding  from an  intellectual perspective, this  activity is
(currently)  a  side  project  and  we  believe  that  making  it  too
“academic” might impair  our enthusiasm. At the same  time, it rapidly
turned evident  that having a  goal is  necessary to keep  the dynamic
going. Given that we work in  different domains and sectors, finding a
common target for this initiative can be challenging.

\section{Next steps}

The reading  group has  enabled us  to go  through many  different use
cases, reported  in the press,  in the scientific  literature, through
outreach  initiatives,  etc.  We  aim to  pursue  this  initiative  in
different directions.

We  wish  to  extend  the  sessions   of  the  reading  group  to  new
participants.  In   particular,  we  are  interested   in  kicking-off
collaborations with  practitioners from other disciplines  who have an
interest  in  the  topics  of  the cafe-philo.  In  addition,  we  are
interested in  building on top  an initiative from two  researchers in
mathematics associated with the University  of Cambridge in the UK and
the  University of  Aachen in  Germany  who have  been implementing  a
framework in the form of  a comprehensive manifesto \cite{chiodo23} to
guide  the   responsible  and   ethical  development   of  data-driven
projects. A  co-author of  the paper  is currently  experimenting with
using the framework in teaching mobility data analytics with Python as
part  of  a final  year  module  at  École  des Ponts  ParisTech.  The
objective  is  to  incentivize  students  to  the  ethical  challenges
associated  with  developing  a  project that  uses  data  to  support
decision-making,   and    make   them   think   out    of   a   purely
performance-oriented  mindset.  In  general,  we  wish  to  develop  a
framework similar to the one proposed by Chiodo and Muller and adapted
to the  specifics of computer science.  In that direction, we  plan to
perform  a  benchmark of  existing  toolsets  for teaching  ethics  to
computer   scientists,   especially   in   French   Doctoral   Schools
(\textit{e.g.,} \cite{moocEthics}).  We would like to  invite everyone
interested in this initiative to get in touch with us.

Among his research and development projects, he is exploring ideas for
fighting  abuse (spam,  phishing, etc.)  involving domain  names. Some
registries,  such as  the .nl  and .be  registries, already  implement
techniques  based  on  machine  learning  in  order  to  identify,  at
registration   time,  risk   factors  that   may  indicate   malicious
intent.  But how  can  one make  sure  that these  tools  are free  of
undesirable side-effects?  His participating in this  reading group is
one way to find answers to this question.

He is particularly interested in explainability of AI models: it is an
important aspect  in the search for  ethics. He is also  interested in
questions regarding privacy and combating digital exclusion.

digitalization, and  their impact on  people and the  environment. She
reads about, listens  to and watches a lot about  ethics, history, and
geopolitics, that  are all  great sources  of inspiration  to question
research  from  the what  for,  why  and  how perspective.  Daphné  is

began  his  career  in 1996  with  the Internet  Service
Provider Club-Internet.  Over the  years, he  has worked  with various
organizations, including Cisco, Vivendi Universal, Credit Suisse First
Boston,  Airbus/Dimension  Data,  Force10   Networks,  and  Dell.  His
academic journey started in  2012 with a Ph.D. at the  LAAS CNRS and a
two-year PostDoc  at the University  of Tokyo. His doctoral  thesis is
about   open-source  OpenFlow   SDN  for   Internet  Exchange   Points
(IXPs). Today, he is a senior researcher at IIJ Lab in Japan.

The  rapid evolution  of  internet infrastructure  over  the past  few
decades  has  undeniably  transformed  the  landscape  of  our  global
society.  With  approximately  65\%  of  the  world’s  population  now
connected  online,  the pervasive  nature  of  this digital  realm  is
evident.  While  this connectivity has brought  many opportunities and
benefits,  it has  also given  rise to  significant challenges.  Among
these are  the emerging societal  issues, such as the  digital divide,
the society of control that also  appeared as a unique response to the
security  or   control  dilemma,  and  the   undeniable  environmental
implications and sustainability issues.

Given these  challenges, it  becomes essential  to address  a research
question:  How  can  we  envision  Internet  and  computer  networking
technologies to be more attuned to human-centric values and prioritize
small, localized scales of operation?

Computer  networking  researchers  can  not ignore  or  avoid  ethical
questions. Marc has been examining  and exploring the potential avenue
in  low-tech solutions  combined with  free software  and hardware  as
choices.  By  advocating a  low-tech  approach,  we could  potentially
reduce the  environmental footprint  of our digital  activities. Using
free  software and  hardware  ensures that  these technologies  remain
accessible, adaptable,  and resilient against  monopolistic tendencies
that can sometimes stifle innovation and inclusivity.
